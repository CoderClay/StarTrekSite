# StarTrekSite


Welcome to the GitHub repo for my Star Trek site.

This site may look like a simple fan website, but it's a whole lot more. This site is a template, an assembled implimentation
of a responsive Bootstrap 4 website. Along the way I utilize several types of cards, a nav and a warning box. All of which show up nicely on all size screens. This is a work in progress and I would love to hear anyone's feedback. 

Stick around, pull me, fork me, contribute to the wiki.
